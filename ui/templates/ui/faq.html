          <p>
            FoodLens is an AI-powered tool that analyzes images of fruits &amp; vegetables
            to estimate their freshness or rottenness. By using computer vision, it helps
            users identify produce quality before purchase or consumption.

        <button class="faq-question">How does FoodLens determine freshness?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            When you upload an image, our trained AI model analyzes color, texture, and
            visual features unique to each type of produce. It then generates a freshness
            score based on patterns it learned from thousands of labeled images.

        <button class="faq-question">Which fruits &amp; vegetables are supported?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Currently, FoodLens can analyze:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Bananas</li>
            <li>Bell Peppers</li>
            <li>Bitter Gourds</li>
            <li>Cucumbers</li>

            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>

          <p>We plan to expand to more items in future versions.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How accurate is the AI model?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Our model achieves an average accuracy of 85–90%, depending on lighting
            conditions and image clarity. Continuous training and dataset updates help
            improve accuracy over time.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What kind of images should I upload?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>For best results:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use natural lighting (avoid harsh shadows).</li>
            <li>Place the produce on a plain background.</li>
            <li>Ensure the entire fruit or vegetable is visible in the frame.</li>
          </ul>

      <!-- 6 -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is my uploaded image stored permanently?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No. FoodLens only stores your image if you choose to provide feedback on the
            model’s prediction. If you don’t provide feedback, your image is automatically
            deleted after processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you do provide feedback, your image is linked to your account so that our
            team can contact you if follow-up questions arise or if we need clarification
            to help improve model accuracy.

      <!-- 7 -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Can FoodLens detect mold or damage?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes, to a certain extent. The AI can recognize surface-level defects such as
            bruises, mold, or discoloration that typically indicate spoilage. However, it
            cannot detect internal issues that are not visible from the outside.

      <!-- 8 -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Does lighting or background affect the results?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes. Extremely dark or overly bright lighting may reduce accuracy. We recommend
            photographing your produce under natural indoor or outdoor lighting against a
            neutral background.

      <!-- 9 -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Can I use FoodLens for commercial or market purposes?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Not yet. FoodLens is currently designed for testing, research, and educational
            use only. However, future versions are planned for integration into commercial
            and market environments to help automate quality control, improve inventory
            management, reduce labor costs, and minimize both the environmental and
            financial impact of food waste.

      <!-- 10 -->
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is FoodLens free to use?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Every user receives 3 free uploads without an account. After those initial
            uploads, you’ll be asked to create a free account to continue using FoodLens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only the feedback you provide is saved to your account, which includes your
            uploaded image, the AI model’s prediction results, and your input or comments
            about the outcome. This allows you to track your past feedback and helps our
            team continue improving FoodLens accuracy.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Who developed FoodLens?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            FoodLens was created by a team of five senior students at the University of
            Louisiana at Lafayette. Each team member contributed a different area of
            expertise including AI development, data integration, UI/UX design, frontend
            development, and database management to build a user-friendly, AI-powered tool
            that helps people assess the freshness of their produce.
