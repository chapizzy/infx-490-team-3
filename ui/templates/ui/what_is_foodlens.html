          <p>
            FoodLens is an innovative AI-powered application designed to assess
            the quality and freshness of perishable food items. By combining
            advanced image recognition technology with an intuitive user
            interface, FoodLens helps consumers make safer, more informed
            decisions about the food they eat. Our goal is to reduce food waste,
            promote food safety awareness, and empower individuals to better
            understand the lifespan of their produce.

          <h3 class="orange-text">Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            We believe technology should make everyday choices smarter, safer,
            and more sustainable. FoodLens represents our shared commitment to
            innovation, education, and real-world impact. Our mission is to
            harness the power of artificial intelligence to bridge the gap
            between technology and everyday life, creating a tool that promotes
            awareness, accessibility, and sustainability in food consumption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through this project, we aim to inspire change in how people think
            about their food by empowering them to minimize waste, make informed
            choices, and gain confidence in the quality of what they consume. By
            combining data science, user-centered design, and creative
            collaboration, we strive to make FoodLens not just an app, but a
            step toward a smarter, more sustainable future.
